# sample-python-project

## Setup a new Python 3 project
> Install VS Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

> Install Python 3 - https://realpython.com/installing-python/

> In VS Code, open a new workspace called ‘python workspace’

> Open up new Terminal window from the `Terminal -> New Terminal` menu item and check python version with `python --version`. It should be `3.X.X`

> Create a new project folder virtual environment with: `python -m venv my_project` followed by `source my_project/bin/activate`
What we've done here is created a project folder and activated a dedicated python work environment where any project depedencies or libraries can be isolated to just this project folder. 

A few basic linux commands to navigate in the terminal:
1. `ls` - lists all the files and folders in your directory
2. `cd <folder name> ` - change directory to <folder name>
3. `cd ../` - change back up a directory
4. `pwd` - tells you where you are in your file system
